# Wiki-Movies

This is a series of files, each of which contains the previous plus the next step in the ETL process.

The final file will execute the whole process.

Please note that adding the kaggle cleaning code into the Deliverable 2 would have returned the combined code, which would not be returned correctly. Furthermore, adding the database function to the middle of the ETL block seemed strange. Instead, I added the code to clean the kaggle data seperately and below the original ETL function and merged the dataframes there, then set up the database. While this is different than the exact wording of the assignment, it is substantively the same. The code is sound and should execute correctly. Please see the code blocks below the wiki_movies metadata for Deliverable 3 and 4.
